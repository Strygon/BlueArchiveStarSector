# BlueArchiveStarSector
 This is a mod for Starsector that integrates the factions and characters of Blue Archive into the game.

 Advisory: This repository is open primarily to allow for downloads of new releases. I am not doing this professionally, my code is a bit of a cobbled together mess, and I have never been that good at organizing things so the issues list can be a bit messy. Nevertheless, if you wish to contribute, I will gladly accept any assistance.

This repository is updated semi-frequently. I advise against downloading the code directly unless you want unfinished features, untested ships/weapons, downright broken builds or a variety of other problems typically fixed before a release. I suggest only downloading it if you really know what you're doing.
