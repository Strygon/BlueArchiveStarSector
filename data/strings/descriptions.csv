ba_mil_astra,SHIP,"The Astra is one of Millennium's proprietary frigate designs. For the most part a fairly middle of the road ship, the Astra does possess a much larger forward weapon mount, typically used for mounting various kinds of  powerful beams.",,,,,,,
ba_mil_constellation,SHIP,"Combining an impressive hangar and respectable set of armaments, the Constellation is Millennium's top choice for large carrier engagements, and one of the Engineering Department's proudest designs.

The Constellation can, in some ways, be seen as a push by Seminar towards a more power projection focused doctrine as the school not only ensures its own survival against other powerhouses like Trinity and Gehenna, it also allows Millennium to be seen as a force to be reckoned with within the Sector.

However, the Constellation is not without its flaws. The ship's weaponry, while impressive and certainly able to pack a punch of their own, should only be used as a last resort, as the ship itself cannot survive an extended ship-to-ship engagement. Furthermore, the ship is (much to Treasurer Hayase's dismay) hideously expensive to produce and maintain. Therefore the best place for a Constellation is always next to a battleship or two and some healthy distance behind a crowd of screening ships.

Nevertheless, the Constellation is a fitting microcosm of the school that built it. Always on the bleeding edge of technology, no matter the cost or risks.",,,,,,,
ba_poincare,CUSTOM,"Poincare is the first planet settled by the Millennium Science School after the Engineering Department's successful experimentation on Hyperspace Drives. It initially acted as a mere science outpost before the Collapse forced Seminar to redesignate Poincare as the new capital of Millennium, with the student council having officially moved offices from the now lost Kivotos to here.",,"The Millennium logo shines brightly over the docking bays as you approach the station. Upon getting past border control, you take note of the students working tirelessly to load and unload cargo and maintain the station around you.

On one of the many holo-posters you see an advertisement for the new hit game Tales Saga Chronicles 4: Answer, apparently developed in-house by this very school.

A monowheeled machine rolls up to you and scans your access clearance card, before handing out a complimentary cup of coffee. This is no doubt one of Millennium's security drones. You wish you had one of those back in your ship.",,"Poincare is the first planet settled by the Millennium Science School after the Engineering Department's successful experimentation on Hyperspace Drives. It initially acted as a mere science outpost before the Collapse forced Seminar to redesignate Poincare as the new capital of Millennium, with the student council having officially moved offices from the now lost Kivotos to here.",,,
ba_riemann,CUSTOM,"A desert world not too dissimilar from the great wastes where Abydos formerly was located, Riemann was the second planet chosen by MIllennium's Interstellar Exploration Initiative. Initially meant as a spot for scientists to research how soil conditions are affected by the presence of a different star, along with some environmental studies regarding how a planet can become completely wrought with desertification, it has now become a home for many people who stake out a living with moisture farming, mining or technological development.",,,,,,,
ba_yangmills,CUSTOM,"Yang-Mills is Millennium's most recent colony, primarily meant as a long-term experiment into how a permanent settlement can be established on a lifeless planet. The cold and harsh environment (often the subject to petitions to have it renamed after Millennium's equally cold and harsh treasurer) presents a significant challenge to Millennium's researchers, but despite that, a significant subterranean settlement has been founded, which now flourishes thanks to the rich ore veins discovered shortly after the first settlement was constructed.",,,,,,,
millenium,FACTION,"The Millennium Science School is one of the three big academies of Kivotos, next to Trinity General School and the Gehenna Academy. Millennium specializes primarily in STEM education, standing at the forefront of scientific research and technological development.

It was thanks to the Millennium's Engineering Department that the schools of Kivotos managed to expand into the Persean Sector, though notably much later than the Domain. As part of its interstellar exploration initiative, Millennium discovered the Landon star system and settled on its three main planets, Poincare, Riemann and Yang-Mills.

However, as Seminar was conducting its usual inspections at Poincare, the Collapse occurred. With it, Kivotos and the original academy district of Millennium became completely unreachable, forcing the school to adopt Poincare as its new capital.

Since then, Millennium has arguably recovered the best out of all the schools, in no small part due to the work of the Engineering Department which allowed the school to amass a respectable naval force rivalling even Trinity's Constitutional Navy.

Today, Millennium largely competes very heavily with Tri-Tachyon over various technological fields such as energy weapons research and high tech ship components, but shares the corporation's tendency to be rather lax on AI regulation, a fact that has caused the school to butt heads with the Hegemony a lot. However, neither party is particularly keen on escalating this to a full blown war just yet.

Millennium is headed by the current head of the student council, Tsukatsuki Rio. Unlike the other heads of school like Makoto or the Tea Party, Rio hardly makes her intentions public and is typically rarely seen in public.",,,,,,,
