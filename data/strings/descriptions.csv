ba_mil_astra,SHIP,"The Astra is one of Millennium's proprietary frigate designs. For the most part a fairly middle of the road ship, the Astra does possess a much larger forward weapon mount, typically used for mounting various kinds of  powerful beams.",,,,,,,
ba_mil_constellation,SHIP,"Combining an impressive hangar and respectable set of armaments, the Constellation is Millennium's top choice for large carrier engagements, and one of the Engineering Department's proudest designs.

The Constellation can, in some ways, be seen as a push by Seminar towards a more power projection focused doctrine as the school not only ensures its own survival against other powerhouses like Trinity and Gehenna, it also allows Millennium to be seen as a force to be reckoned with within the Sector.

However, the Constellation is not without its flaws. The ship's weaponry, while impressive and certainly able to pack a punch of their own, should only be used as a last resort, as the ship itself cannot survive an extended ship-to-ship engagement. Furthermore, the ship is (much to Treasurer Hayase's dismay) hideously expensive to produce and maintain. Therefore the best place for a Constellation is always next to a battleship or two and some healthy distance behind a crowd of screening ships.

Nevertheless, the Constellation is a fitting microcosm of the school that built it. Always on the bleeding edge of technology, no matter the cost or risks.",,,,,,,
ba_poincare,CUSTOM,"Poincare is the first planet settled by the Millennium Science School after the Engineering Department's successful experimentation on Hyperspace Drives. It initially acted as a mere science outpost before the Collapse forced Seminar to redesignate Poincare as the new capital of Millennium, with the student council having officially moved offices from the now lost Kivotos to here.",,"The Millennium logo shines brightly over the docking bays as you approach the station. Upon getting past border control, you take note of the students working tirelessly to load and unload cargo and maintain the station around you.

On one of the many holo-posters you see an advertisement for the new hit game Tales Saga Chronicles 4: Answer, apparently developed in-house by this very school.

A monowheeled machine rolls up to you and scans your access clearance card, before handing out a complimentary cup of coffee. This is no doubt one of Millennium's security drones. You wish you had one of those back in your ship.",,"Poincare is the first planet settled by the Millennium Science School after the Engineering Department's successful experimentation on Hyperspace Drives. It initially acted as a mere science outpost before the Collapse forced Seminar to redesignate Poincare as the new capital of Millennium, with the student council having officially moved offices from the now lost Kivotos to here.",,,
ba_riemann,CUSTOM,"A desert world not too dissimilar from the great wastes where Abydos formerly was located, Riemann was the second planet chosen by MIllennium's Interstellar Exploration Initiative. Initially meant as a spot for scientists to research how soil conditions are affected by the presence of a different star, along with some environmental studies regarding how a planet can become completely wrought with desertification, it has now become a home for many people who stake out a living with moisture farming, mining or technological development.",,,,,,,
ba_yangmills,CUSTOM,"Yang-Mills is Millennium's most recent colony, primarily meant as a long-term experiment into how a permanent settlement can be established on a lifeless planet. The cold and harsh environment (often the subject to petitions to have it renamed after Millennium's equally cold and harsh treasurer) presents a significant challenge to Millennium's researchers, but despite that, a significant subterranean settlement has been founded, which now flourishes thanks to the rich ore veins discovered shortly after the first settlement was constructed.",,,,,,,
ba_deus,CUSTOM,"Deus is the Trinity General School's capital planet and the first colony set up by Trinity after leaving Kivotos for the first time. Unlike most other Trinity colonies, which are usually headed by one particular faction, Deus is headed by all represented factions of Trinity and is first and foremost, ""Trinity's World"".  The lush terran world has over time become Trinity's crown jewel of their now ever growing territories, much to the fuming jealousy of the Gehenna Academy.",,,,,,,
ba_spiritus,CUSTOM,"Spiritus was right upon its discovery a planet of intense interest. The planet is littered with ancient ruins and lost scriptures, which made it a target of high priority for the Sanctus Faction, which enacted the Sisterhood Artifact Acquisition Decree, allowing it unfettered access to the planet. Eventually, in order to support the exploration and decryption efforts by the SIsterhood, Sanctus expanded the permanent settlements around Spiritus until those grew into full fledged cities. This resulted in Spiritus recently opening up its ports for trade and commerce, but many locations on the surface are still completely restricted, only allowing access to Sisterhood members.",,,,,,,
ba_watchpointbeta,CUSTOM,"Watchpoint Beta is , by all accounts, utterly boring. Public knowledge states it is a barren rock with no interesting features, granting it the oft reviled by colonists and explorers alike classification of a Class I Planet. Yet despite this, the Sisterhood has constructed a sizeable base on this planet for reasons no one is entirely sure of. Furthermore many of the featureless and unmarked buildings constructed by the Sisters are not on any public record, and the Sisterhood itself refuses to make the purpose of these buildings public, though that in itself is nothing new for a faction practically infamous for its mountain of secrets. However, daredevils and troublemakers that try to break into these facilities have never been known to return upon almost certain capture by the Sisterhood.",,,,,,,
millenium,FACTION,"The Millennium Science School is one of the three big academies of Kivotos, next to Trinity General School and the Gehenna Academy. Millennium specializes primarily in STEM education, standing at the forefront of scientific research and technological development.

It was thanks to the Millennium's Engineering Department that the schools of Kivotos managed to expand into the Persean Sector, though notably much later than the Domain. As part of its interstellar exploration initiative, Millennium discovered the Landon star system and settled on its three main planets, Poincare, Riemann and Yang-Mills.

However, as Seminar was conducting its usual inspections at Poincare, the Collapse occurred. With it, Kivotos and the original academy district of Millennium became completely unreachable, forcing the school to adopt Poincare as its new capital.

Since then, Millennium has arguably recovered the best out of all the schools, in no small part due to the work of the Engineering Department which allowed the school to amass a respectable naval force rivalling even Trinity's Constitutional Navy.

Today, Millennium largely competes very heavily with Tri-Tachyon over various technological fields such as energy weapons research and high tech ship components, but shares the corporation's tendency to be rather lax on AI regulation, a fact that has caused the school to butt heads with the Hegemony a lot. However, neither party is particularly keen on escalating this to a full blown war just yet.

Millennium is headed by the current head of the student council, Tsukatsuki Rio. Unlike the other heads of school like Makoto or the Tea Party, Rio hardly makes her intentions public and is typically rarely seen in public.",,,,,,,
trinity,FACTION,"As one of the oldest schools of Kivotos, the Trinity General School is a prestigious and religious academy embodying both the ""pen"" and the ""sword"". It places high importance on matters such as etiquette, order and elegance, which squarely puts it at odds with the rivalling Gehenna Academy. As a result, their long standing bitter rivalry has continued well beyond Kivotos and has moved into the Persean Sector.

The school had formed from a number of warring and bickering factions, eventually being headed by the Pater, Filius and Sanctus factions that now form the leadership council known as the ""Trinity Tea Party"". This is now particularly reflected in the somewhat loosely controlled colonial policy of Trinity, as the individual factions much prefer to construct colonies on their own rather than act as one unit. The sheer size of Trinity has made it difficult for the Tea Party to properly reign the various factions acting on their own and as a result, materials always end up getting lost, fleets end up where they shouldn't be and cooperation between factions has somewhat broken down a bit.

Nevertheless, even with these issues, Trinity stands as possibly the largest naval power among the Kivotos schools, owing this primarily due to their close cooperation with the Hegemony. The school's religious subfaction, the Sisterhood, which has been given a degree of operational autonomy, has also been working hard to keep Trinity safe from the Luddic Path, even if some Church members have been mysteriously going missing as a result. Despite the Luddic Church's inquiries however, the Sanctus Faction has so far refused to comment on the matter.

Trinity's Tea Party is currently headed by the three presidents, the elegant and calculating Kirifuji Nagisa, the popular and energetic Misono Mika, and the wise and mysterious Yurizono Seia. Due to their huge amount of work regarding Trinity, it is infamously difficult to meet any Tea Party member other than Mika.",,,,,,,
gehenna,FACTION,"Gehenna is another one of Kivotos' oldest schools next to Trinity, originally also occupying just as much territory. However, in stark contrast to the rigidly traditional and hierarchical Trinity school, Gehenna's capacity for chaos, treachery, anarchy and unrelenting destruction within its own territory is legendary. The official motto of the academy is ""Freedom and Chaos"", a phrase that strongly reflects the day to day culture of most of Gehenna's students, who will happily form their own less-than-legal circles and make use of official infrastructure as they please. The end result is that the few who do wish to behave like a civilized person typically have to restrict themselves to the lesser used campus buildings and stations.

Almost immediately after Millennium discovered the Persean Sector and interstellar travel, the Pandemonium Society, which leads Gehenna, dedicated all of its resources towards expanding outward into space before ""those stuck up Trinity brats steal all the territory first"", according to Chairman Makoto. Following a daring theft of one of Millennium's ""grand and powerful warships"" (actually a Colossus freighter the school bought off the black market) and blowing almost the entire budget of the school on starships and colony facilites (an act that very nearly caused the school to completely collapse, had the Prefect Team not stepped in at the final second and both restored a modicum of order and negotiated (read: forced at gunpoint) a budget adjustment to at least keep some money aside for basic utilities), Gehenna was the second school to actually reach the Sector and establish a permanent presence there, immediately garnering a lot of favor with the local pirates due to their carefree and lax attitude to life, and accidentally angering a Hegemony fleet along the way.

The school and its territory would have long collapsed into uncontrollable anarchy were it not for the efforts of the Prefect Team, which in many ways is the last line of defense for anything resembling ordinary civilization in Gehenna, leading to the misconception that the Prefect Team President, Soarasaki Hina, is the leader of Gehenna. This is in fact incorrect, with the real leader being the Chairman of the Pandemonium Society, Hanuma Makoto, who not only does nothing to halt the ever growing chaos in Gehenna and in fact, endorses and encourages it.

Unlike most other school leads, Makoto is quite easily available for meetings and discussions to other starship captains, but her incompetence and general refusal to commit to anything that doesn't involve either blowing up a Trinity structure, sabotaging the Prefect Team or playing games with Ibuki, has made her rather unpopular as a client for potential contracts and operations, let alone getting anything useful done in Gehenna.",,,,,,,
arius,FACTION,"To call Arius a ""school"" could be considered an act of generosity. The Arius Branch School is a loose faction of former Trinity students turned radical extremists. Much like the Luddic Path, the presence of Arius members ephermates throughout the Persean Sector, often in the form of hidden cells in various colonies and planets, though unlike the Path there is indeed an actual hierarchy within Arius' leadership, but the location of said leadership is completely unknown. The same can also be said for the identities of those leading Arius. Meanwhile the ""students"" often engage in acts of terrorism throughout the Sector against effectively anyone and everyone, usually to carry out the ""hatred"" carried within everyone at Arius, though the primary target of Arius will always be Trinity.

Arius does maintain a couple official holdings, usually for the sake of black market trade, as they have become a major enemy of the entire Sector thanks to their extremist activities. 

Strangely, there was a short period 10 or so years ago where Arius had nearly completely collapsed due to presumed infighting. However, since then it seems that the school has once more become united and since then their attacks have been increasing with ever more ferocious vitriol. No one is entirely certain why that is the case, and Trinity is either unable or unwilling to look into a solution to reconcile with Arius and possibly put an end to Arius' reign of terror. The closest we have had to an official statement explaining their actions is Arius Squad's leader, Joumae Saori, declaring that Arius will continue until first Trinity, and then the rest of the Sector is ""turned into nothing but ashes"".",,,,,,,
ba_mil_intervention,SHIP,"The Intervention fills a vital role in Millennium's defense doctrine by enabling the rapid deployment of fighters wherever they are needed. When the Treasurer of Seminar denied the Engineering Department's request for funding to ""simply build more Constellations to plug holes in our defenses"", the Engineering Club had to get creative. The end result is a carrier that puts speed above everything else and is (relatively) cheap compared to its monstrous brother. Of course, some compromises had to be made, primarily in the armor and hull department, so that same speed should also be used to keep enemy fire at bay.",,,,,,,
ba_mil_alkahest,SHIP,"While the Millennium Engineering Department was busy with the design of the Constellation, Seminar decided to hire another manufacturing and design company to develop some new fleet designs. One of these new designs is the Alkahest, which is noted for its distinctive shape and focus on overwhelming forward focusing firepower. Any fight with an Alkahest depends entirely on how long someone stays in front of its forward firing arc, as the combined firepower can easily melt through shield and armor alike. However, this does have the drawback that its other firing arcs are very weak. Therefore, these cruisers should best be used in a flanking role where they open fire on unshielded areas of the ship for a quick and decisive blow.",,,,,,,
ba_mil_lightspeed,SHIP,"The Lightspeed was formerly a rejected design for the Intervention Program, eventually revived to serve as an interceptor destroyer instead. It still carries the same ""speed above all else"" doctrine of the Intervention, but instead of deploying fighters it carries a respectable armament of weapons, as the runways were swapped out with gun platforms",,,,,,,
ba_mil_fregata,SHIP,"Competing with the Lightspeed for a high speed destroyer design was the Fregata. Where the Lightspeed was relatively reasonable with speed and still chose to employ a degree of firepower, the Fregata sacrifices both armor and firepower for more speed. That's not to say it's completely harmless though, thanks to its burn drive it can easily perform hit and run attacks against slower ships.",,,,,,,
ba_mil_goliath,SHIP,"With the Constellation too weak to sustain continued engagements and the need for a ship to effectively act as a ""tank"", the Goliath was developed. Meant to both employ incredibly powerful shields and very thick armor, the Goliath's main role is to soak hits so that more fragile ships can carry out their roles. Initially meant to be designated the ""Gorilla""-class Battleship, it was later renamed to Goliath to avoid causing unnecessary political trouble by offending members of the Trinity Tea Party.
But just like a gorilla, it is not only good at soaking hits, it can also dish out a nasty punch of its own. While Goliaths come few and far between (due to their absolutely outrageous price tag), the presence of one always spells immense trouble for whoever it was meant for.",,,,,,,
ba_mil_northhampton,SHIP,"The Northhampton is a favorite among the Materials Science Department of Millennium, who initially developed this ship as a larger shuttle to ferry around materials between planets. After some ships were lost to pirate attacks, the Materials Science Department embezzled funding from Seminar (under the guise of ""discovering an exotic new material that requires more funding to recreate"") to remodel the Northhampton into a respectable attack frigate to ward off the pirate attacks. After the embezzlement was discovered and the students responsible for it were heavily scolded by Treasurer Hayase, the design was then put under official Millennium military use thanks to its relative cheapness and versatility.",,,,,,,
