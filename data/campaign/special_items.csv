While integrated with a hyperdrive this device allows a hyperwave pulse tuned to the unique resonant signatures of two Gates to be transmitted into a Gate aperture. After a tremendous energy input which requires a great quantity of fuel to generate, a temporary link between those Gates is created. One ship or fleet may then transit the Gate network.",0
